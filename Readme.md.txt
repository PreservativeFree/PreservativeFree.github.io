Hello, I'm Nelson Moreno and this is my portfolio.
The new tech that I was learning this year is JavaScript. It is a really handy language that works really well with HTML web pages. 
In class we’ve been using Visual Studio Code as the IDE and been using Node.js which is a package that helps run JavaScript files by typing out “Node fileName.js” in the Visual Studio terminal. The way I’ve used it primarily is for problem solving and theory. There seems to be hesitancy on working with data taken from the web because of the security risk it might pose. 
There are multiple other software that works with JavaScript and Visual Studio Code which 
I will refer to as “middle ware”. So, express, cors, nodemon, dotenv, Sequelize, pgweb, 
rollbar, and Heroku are great middle ware options in the hands of an expert, 
but when they run into errors it is difficult to track what caused a specific error 
and what can be done to prevent that error from happening again.
I am all about the Java programming language. I’ve made large projects succeed with the 
language. I’ve been able to create a text game created in Java, and I’ve imported the 
backbone into the C# (Java-based) language to add a layer of paint with great success. 
My github page contains a repo where I wrote a small java game that you can check out at 
https://github.com/PreservativeFree/Space-Invaders.
